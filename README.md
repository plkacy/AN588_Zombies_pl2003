Challenges: 
Time management: The homework took longer than expected for me and didn't share my code with my peers in time. I also was not effecient with communicating with my peers.
Answering the questions with code: I'm not sure if I completed question 5 and 6 correctly. I'm also not too familiar with loops for question 6 when combining the data. (may need to be organized better) For number 4, there may be an easier way of doing it without listing each plot at a time. (I just referenced one of the modules from class)
