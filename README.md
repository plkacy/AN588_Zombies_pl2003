Challenges: 
Time management: Time management was a major challenge for this assignment. The homework took longer than expected, which delayed me from sharing my code with my peers on time. Additionally, I was not efficient in communicating with my peers, which could have improved our collaboration. Moving forward, I will manage my time better and prioritize clearer communication to ensure smoother teamwork.

Answering the questions with code: I'm not sure if I completed question 5 and 6 correctly. I'm also not too familiar with loops for question 6 when combining the data. (may need to be organized better) For number 4, there may be an easier way of doing it without listing each plot at a time. (I just referenced one of the modules from class)
