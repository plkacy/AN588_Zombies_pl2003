Challenges: 
I'm not sure if I completed question 5 and 6 correctly. 
I'm also not too familiar with loops for question 6 when combining the data. (may need to be organized better) 
For number 4, there may be an easier way of doing it without listing each plot at a time. (I just referenced one of the modules from class)
