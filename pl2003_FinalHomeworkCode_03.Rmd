## Boxplots of quantitative variables by gender

```{r}
#plot for gender and height 
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = height))  #Define variables
p <- p + geom_boxplot()  #Graph them in boxplot
p <- p + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Height (cm)")  # Rename axes
p <- p + ggtitle("Height by Gender")  # Add title
p  # Show plot

#plot for weight by gender
p <- ggplot(data=zombies, aes (x=gender, y=weight))
p <- p + geom_boxplot()  #Graph them in boxplot
p <- p + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Weight (kg)")  # Rename axes
p <- p + ggtitle("Height by Gender")  # Add title
p  # Show plot

#plot for gender and age
p <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = age))  #Define variables
p <- p + geom_boxplot()  #Graph them in boxplot
p <- p + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Age (years)")  # Rename axes
p <- p + ggtitle("Age by Gender")  # Add title
p  # Show plot

#plot for gender and zombies killed
p <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = zombies_killed))
p <- p + geom_boxplot()
p <- p + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Zombies Killed")
p <- p + ggtitle("Zombies Killed by Gender")
p

#plotfor gender and years of education 
p <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = years_of_education))
p <- p + geom_boxplot()
p <- p + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Years of Education")
p <- p + ggtitle("Years of Education by Gender")
p

```
#add colors by filling (boxplots)
#ggloop to loop ggplot codes to make it all at once 

## Scatterplots of height and weight vs. age

```{r}
#Scatterplot of height in relation to age
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = age, y = height))  # Define variables
p <- p + xlab("Age (years)") + ylab("Height (cm)")  # Modify axis labels
p <- p + geom_point()  # Make a scatterplot
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = "lm")  # Add a trend line
p  # Plot the object


#Scatterplot of weight in relation to age
p <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = age, y = weight))  
p <- p + xlab("Age (years)") + ylab("Weight (kg)")  
p <- p + geom_point()  
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = "lm")  
p  
```
Both of the trend lines show a positive slope, suggesting that height/weight increases with age. The difference is that weight by age in survivors is less strongly correlated because the plots are more spread out, but it still has a positive correlation.

Interpreting the Variables

Height and weight- Both variables display a symmetric bell-shaped histogram and their Q-Q plots align closely with the red diagonal line, indicating a normal distribution.

Age- The histogram shows slight left skewness, and the Q-Q plot suggests deviations from normality, indicating it may follow a skewed distribution rather than a normal one.

Zombies killed- The distribution is highly skewed, suggesting it does not follow a normal distribution. Given that this variable represents count data, it may follow a Poisson or negative binomial distribution.

Years of education- The distribution appears slightly skewed but may still be approximately normal. Further tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test, could better confirm normality.


## Sample 30 survivors and calculate confidence intervals

```{r}
set.seed(42) #reproducibility
sample_30 <- zombies[sample(nrow(zombies), 30, replace = FALSE),]  # Take a random sample of 30 zombies without replacement

numeric_vars <- c("height", "weight", "age", "zombies_killed", "years_of_education") #vector to extract from sample

# Compute means for each selected columns
sample_means <- colMeans(sample_30[, numeric_vars])

# Compute sample standard deviations
sample_sds <- apply(sample_30[, numeric_vars], 2, sd)

# Print results
sample_means
sample_sds

sample_se <- sample_sds / sqrt(30)  # Standard error formula: SD / sqrt(n)

# Print SE
sample_se

# Compute 95% confidence interval: mean Â± 1.96 * SE
ci_lower <- sample_means - 1.96 * sample_se
ci_upper <- sample_means + 1.96 * sample_se

# Combine results into a table
confidence_intervals <- data.frame(Variable = numeric_vars, Mean = sample_means, Lower_95_CI = ci_lower, Upper_95_CI = ci_upper)

# Print the confidence intervals
confidence_intervals
``` 
The 95% confidence interval formula: mean +/- 1.96 * SE
1.96 is the critical value for a normal distribution at a 95% confidence level. If we took more samples, 95% of them would contain the true poplation mean within the range. 

## Sampling distribution and comparison with standard errors

```{r}
set.seed(42) # Set the random seed for reproducibility

# Defining the numeric variables 
numeric_vars <- c("height", "weight", "age", "zombies_killed", "years_of_education")

# Create an empty list to store the sample means
sample_means_list <- list()

# Loop to take 99 random samples of 30 zombie survivors
for (i in 1:99) { sample_i <- zombies[sample(nrow(zombies), 30, replace = FALSE),]  # Sample from zombies dataset without replacement
sample_means_list[[i]] <- colMeans(sample_i[, numeric_vars], na.rm = TRUE)} #holds the means of samples, sample_i is the sample of 30 rows from zombie data set
#colmeans calulates the mean of columns from numeric_vars, ignoring missing values 

# Convert the list to a data 
sample_means_df <- as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(sample_means_list), nrow = length(sample_means_list), byrow = TRUE)) #unlist- convert to single flat vector, matrix- converts it to matrix form
colnames(sample_means_df) <- numeric_vars  # Assign column names based on numeric_vars

# Add the first sample to the data frame
sample_means_df <- rbind(sample_means_df, sample_means)  # Add the first sample

# Calculate the mean of each variable's sampling distribution
sampling_dist_means <- colMeans(sample_means_df)

# Calculate the standard deviation of each variable's sampling distribution
sampling_dist_sds <- apply(sample_means_df, 2, sd)

# Print the means and standard deviations
sampling_dist_means
sampling_dist_sds

# Comparison with the estimated standard errors
comparison <- data.frame( Variable = numeric_vars, Estimated_SE = sample_se, Sampling_SD = sampling_dist_sds)

# Print the comparison table
comparison

# Create histograms for each variable
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))  # Arrange multiple plots in a 2-row, 3-column grid

for (var in colnames(sample_means_df)) {hist(sample_means_df[[var]], main = paste("Histogram of", var, "Sample Means"), xlab = var)} #loop through each column and create a histogram for each variable

# Create Q-Q plots for each variable
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))  # Arrange multiple plots

for (var in numeric_vars) { qqnorm(sample_means_df[[var]], main = paste("Q-Q Plot of", var, "Sample Means")) #selects values of the variable from sample_means_df to be plotted.
 qqline(sample_means_df[[var]], col = "red")} #add the reference line to compare

```

Height & Weight: The histograms of sample means are approximately normal, consistent with the Central Limit Theorem. Their Q-Q plots also align well with the red diagonal line, further confirming normality.

Age: Despite the original distribution being skewed, the sampling distribution of means appears more symmetric, supporting the idea that sample means are normally distributed.

Zombies Killed: The original data was highly skewed, and while the sampling distribution is less skewed, it still deviates from normality, suggesting it may follow a different underlying distribution, possibly Poisson.

Years of Education: The sample mean distribution is closer to normal compared to the original data, though slight skewness remains. 

These results illustrate how the Central Limit Theorem can help normalize sampling distributions, even when the original variables are not normally distributed.
